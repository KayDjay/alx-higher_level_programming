Task 1 - Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

2. First Rectangle
Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

In the file models/rectangle.py
Class Rectangle inherits from Base
Private instance attributes, each with its own public getter and setter:
__width -> width
__height -> height
__x -> x
__y -> y
Class constructor: def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None):
Call the super class with id - this super call with use the logic of the __init__ of the Base class
Assign each argument width, height, x and y to the right attribute

3. Validate attributes
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):

If the input is not an integer, raise the TypeError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be an integer. Example: width must be an integer
If width or height is under or equals 0, raise the ValueError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be > 0. Example: width must be > 0
If x or y is under 0, raise the ValueError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be >= 0. Example: x must be >= 0

4. Area first
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

5. Display #0
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you don’t need to handle x and y here.
